#Blockchain
In this project I have build a Blockchain using python and Flask framework , Flask is used to interact blockchain with web application. I have used Postman( HTTP client that tests HTTP requests) to test my build API.

blockchain.py is simple blockchain with simple methods examples: mining new block, verifying proof of work ,verifying the block, get the chain of block and displaying it.

Then I jumped to cryptocurrency to make transaction, get whole system decentralized and work on consensus mechanism. For illustration purpose I made 3 nodes namely node_5001.py, node_5002.py,node_5003.py which is acting like real time users/nodes in decentralised system. If new block is added in any node through consensus mechanism it will get replicated to other nodes as well.

I hope you will enjoy my project as you walk through it.....
